# Watchface for Watchy by SQFMI - Rhinetower
no wifi, no bluetooth but long battery life 

there is a time adjustment routine in Watchy_Tower.cpp

every day at 0:30 it sets back time by 15 seconds and 150 ms, because my Watchy runs too fast. Just delete it (or set another adjustment)

according to Guinness World Records the rhinetower is the biggest decimal clock.
